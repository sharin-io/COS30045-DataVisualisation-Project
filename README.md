# Data Visualization Project (COS30045)

## Project Overview

This repository contains the group project for the Data Visualization course (COS30045). Our team is developing an interactive data visualization using D3.js, focusing on health statistics from the OECD database and other related sources, particularly for ASEAN countries.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our team's ability to develop an interactive data visualization that effectively communicates insights from health-related data. Our visualization aims to explore trends in life expectancy and population demographics across ASEAN countries.

### Audience

Our target audience includes policymakers, researchers, and the general public interested in understanding trends in life expectancy and population demographics.

## Data Sources

### Primary Dataset
- [OECD Health Statistics](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/data/oecd-health-statistics_health-data-en)

### Additional Datasets
- [Statista: Life expectancy in ASEAN countries](https://www.statista.com/statistics/life-expectancy-asean/)
- [Macrotrends: Life Expectancy in ASEAN countries](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/ASEAN/life-expectancy)
