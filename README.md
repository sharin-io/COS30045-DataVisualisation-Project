# Data Visualization Project (COS30045)

## Project Overview

This repository contains the group project for the Data Visualization course (COS30045). Our team is developing an interactive data visualization using D3.js, focusing on health statistics from the OECD database and other related sources.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our team's ability to develop an interactive data visualization that effectively communicates insights from health-related data. Our visualization aims to explore trends in life expectancy and population demographics, with a focus on ASEAN countries.

### Audience

Our target audience includes policymakers, researchers, and the general public interested in understanding trends in life expectancy and population demographics.
