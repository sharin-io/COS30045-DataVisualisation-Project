## 🌟 About The Project

An interactive data visualization project focusing on ASEAN health statistics using D3.js. This project analyzes and presents health trends, life expectancy, and population demographics across ASEAN countries through engaging visualizations and data-driven storytelling. Built by students at Swinburne University of Technology for COS30045.

### 🎯 Purpose

Our project aims to demonstrate the ability to develop interactive data visualizations that effectively communicate insights from health-related data. We explore trends in:
- Life expectancy
- Birth rates
- Population demographics across ASEAN countries
- Future implications of these trends

### 👥 Target Audience

- **Policymakers**: To guide healthcare investments and policy decisions
- **Researchers**: To assist with demographic studies and healthcare trend analysis
- **General Public**: To increase awareness about health trends in ASEAN countries

## 📊 Data Sources

### Primary Dataset
- OECD Health Statistics: Comprehensive health data including life expectancy, healthcare access, and demographic statistics

### Additional Datasets
- Statista: Life Expectancy in ASEAN Countries
- Macrotrends: Life Expectancy in ASEAN Countries
- World Bank: Life Expectancy at Birth, Total (Years) - ASEAN
- ASEAN Data: Population and Demographics

## 🎨 Storytelling Approach

1. **Guided Narrative Flow**: 
   - Introduction to ASEAN health trends
   - Specific insights into life expectancy
   - Birth rates and population growth analysis

2. **Context-Rich Explanations**: 
   - Clear explanations of data trends
   - Contextualized information highlighting significance

3. **Progressive Disclosure**: 
   - Key insights revealed progressively
   - Future health trends and implications
   - Healthcare infrastructure impact analysis
